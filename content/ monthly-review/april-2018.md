The month of April has been a hectic one for me. Lots of moving around took its toll on me and I wasn’t feeling well for some time. But regardless, it also brought good news.

## Coding Journey

- During March’s review, I wrote about applying for a BootCamp. Well, the good news is that I got in. I’m so glad everything went according to plan and I will have the opportunity to expand my skills and continue to learn and grow. I resumed work on the 30th and I’m looking forward to a rewarding and fulfiling time at LearnFactory. I wrote about my first day at LearnFactory here.
  
- I completed the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Starting out, I didn’t really believe I would complete it as I had started before and didn’t complete it, but I’m glad was able to start something and see it till the end.
  
- I didn’t work on any new project but I did spend a lot of time refactoring old projects. This is a proof of my growth as it shows I have become better.

## Whats’Up May

- After getting in Learnfactory, I hope to settle in, get familiar with my teammates and colleagues and contribute as much as I can and learn as much as I can also.
    
- On the side, I hope to continue to build up my skills. React is part of what we will be using, so I will be focusing on this.

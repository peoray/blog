This month has been great, I did start some projects as well as contributing to open source projects on GitHub. I was also able to take part in the Hacktoberfest event and completed five Pull Requests

### Open Source

Open Source in the world of technology is denoting software for which the original source code is available for free and may be redistributed and modified. Most programming languages, libraries and frameworks are free to use meaning you don't have to pay any before you can use it.

**Hacktoberfest** is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio.

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
- Five quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories.
- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

This year was my first time participating in Hacktoberfest and I was able to complete the challenge. I made 5 Pull Requests to public GitHub repositories. You can find my stats [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/stats/peoray)

Many people took part in the month-long event, for some, it's their first time participating in Open source and the experience was great. Open source is something I want to do often. It has many benefits, as it can provide opportunities for you.

###  Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)?

I'm always worried, thinking, in a pensive mood. It's something I find myself doing a lot and I can't help. I have asked some people for advice and how to go about it. I was trying to look up for solutions online when I came across GAD. It's a medical condition, it describes the condition I am but, of course, I wasn't diagnosed. I came across Derek Sivers [article](https://sivers.org/donkey) which  did well to help me understand things better and to take it easy on myself.


The year is almost coming to an end and looking back, I can say I have achieved a lot. I have learned and unlearned a lot of things
talk about how it's two months to the end of the year and how you have done a lot or not

### Job Hunting

I continued my job hunting this month, I applied to [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/) for a junior web developer position. Fingers crossed but to be honest, I'm not expecting anything from this.

### Projects

It's been hard for me to get into the zone when building stuff. I have been inconsistent about getting tasks done and finishing a project. I have been building an API for a while now, which is taking a lot of time.

Also, my node project which is an authentication system is the projects I focused on a lot. You can find it [here](https://github.com/peoray/Pristine). I'm proud of the work I have put in and the tons of things I have learned which I can take into other projects.

I also want to take on projects that seems above my level without being scared to actually do it. One of the best advice I have received is to do projects in the ratio of 70:30, 70% known, 30% unknown. This will help me not abandon the projects and also provide the opportunity to learn something new.

### 100 Days of Code

This has been going on even though I haven't been tweeting. Although, I still haven't written any technical article during this period which is part of my goals.

### Picks

- **Awesome Lists:** I started a [personal list](https://github.com/peoray/my-awesome-links) of all the links I find useful as regards web development and others. Hope you find it useful too.

- Kuba mentioned me in his [article](https://medium.com/kuba-michalski-blog/i-wasted-too-much-time-october-2018-934874701b8c) which is cool considering the fact that I started to blog and do monthly reviews like this because of [Bolu](https://medium.com/@Bolu_Ajibawo). It's quite uplifting I have also provided the same motivation for someone to start writing monthly reviews. It has provided the motivation I need to get started writing again.

- **How to start contributing to Open Source:** Kuba also wrote an excellent guide for beginners looking to make their first [Open Source contribution](https://codeburst.io/how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source-d9e38b01a5e1)

- **Why you learn the most when you feel like you’re struggling as a developer:** Walt Schlender brilliant article on [Why you learn the most when you feel like you’re struggling as a developer](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-you-learn-the-most-when-you-feel-like-youre-struggling-as-a-developer-7513327c8ee4) is great. You should definitely check it out!

- **Navigating the Spooky World of JavaScript:** JavaScript can be tedious to grasp especially with all the thousands of frameworks and libraries which can lead to fatigue. In this excellent guide, Ali Spittel talks about [Navigating the Spooky World of JavaScript](https://dev.to/aspittel/navigating-the-spooky-world-of-javascript-3h45) which will help you learn the language without burning out.

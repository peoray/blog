restarting again
talk about brainspace interview process and the stress it left you.
talk about the internship, how it ended, also talk about how you missed the outing and the party cause of the interview
then talk about bubbles
then talk about your choice of projects and your decidion to do 'harder' projects'
I just realise I have an addiciton with trying to organize things and this isn't healthy as I spend lots of time, planning, organizing but in the end, achieve less.

September was a month I experienced something I have never experienced before. I got rejected from a job offer and experienced burnout.

## Be Kind To Others

I have realized helping others is a good way to be happy. I was called by a friend to help with a Vue problem, somehow I manage to solve it, since then he has been calling me to help with problems he encounters when building out his Vue application and I have found solutions to all of them. This is not to brag but the fact that I was able to help and save him from hours of frustrations was cool. His show of thanks also made it worthwhile as I realized that I got better because somehow also helped me. Whether in different Slack groups, StackOverflow, Twitter, etc, I’m grateful for all the help I have received. This also applies to life generally, the world will be a much better place if we all help each other.

## Rejection From a Job

I applied for a Backend position at Appear. Appear is a video chat application that enables you to schedule meetings from anywhere in the world. I applied for the position of JavaScript Developer. From the requirements, I wasn’t qualified but it didn’t hurt to try my luck. After some days, they were gracious to send a mail saying I wasn’t qualified and didn’t meet their requirements.

I didn’t felt bad after, for me, it was an experience and I was glad I took out time to apply.

## Burnout is for the Faint-hearted?

I never really knew what burnout meant until I experienced it myself. I lost all will to do work, I became stress out and constantly having the feeling of anxiety. It can happen to anyone regardless of who you are or your status. At the initial stage, I thought it was just something else, the more I tried to work harder, the difficult it became. Days would go by and I find it super difficult to open up my laptop to do meaningful work.

## Coding Journey

This month didn’t offer much in terms of coding and new projects. I have been doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge and working on building an API using Node. Not the type of progress I want but surely better than nothing. Looking back, I’m proud of how far I have come. At the moment, I might not be in favourable environments but still, my level of work has been great.

## Internship

The Internship has been slacking off and we don’t get much done nowadays, right now, I’m looking forward to the end of it. Of course, there are upsides too which the number one will be the wonderful people I have met and became friends with.

## Picks

- Recovering from Burnout: Kieran Tie talk about his personal experience about experiencing burnout. It’s wonderful and provided insights into how one can survive through it.
  
- Dealing With Programmer Burnout: Brad Traversy talks about programmer’s burnout and how to deal with it. This resonates with me a lit because as a programmer, a lot of what he stated was similar to my own experience. He also gave tips on how to overcome it.
  
- Focus and Deep Work — Your Secret Weapons to Becoming a 10X Developer: Bar Franek provides an excellent article on how to remain focused in a distracted environment as a programmer. Lack of focus and deep work is something a lot of developers including myself struggle with. Bar article shows us ways we can achieve this to gain optimal results.

While September could have been better, I couldn’t be more grateful for the way things played out, hopefully, October will be better.

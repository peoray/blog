## CODING JOURNEY

I submitted a proposal for my first talk for the forLoop Port-Harcourt event. Sadly , it wasn’t accepted. I was gutted but overall it was a good learning experience for me. It wasn’t easy in the first place to submit a tech talk. I was feeling impostor syndrome at a maximum level: What if I screw up, what if the talk isn’t good enough and I get trolled, lots of what ifs but in the end, thanks to friends that gave me the courage to go ahead to submit the talk. This is is part of my goal this year and if the opportunity arises again, I will definitely go for it.

As Brian Tracy Said:

> Move out of your comfort zone. You can only grow if you are willing to feel awkward and uncomfortable when you try something new.

I started round 2 of #100DaysOfCode challenge. In case, you are wondering what it is. You can find out here. I also wrote about my first experience doing the challenge.

I will be learning React as part of the challenge among other goals I have for this round. I have to say my relationship with React might not be bad as it seems, I have decided to embrace a growth mindset and it has paid off. I’m beginning to learn React and enjoying it a bit.

I also got into ESLint and how to set it up with prettier using the AirBnB Styleguide. This is essential as it helps to write clean and readable code.

## PROJECTS

Been learning about backend technologies for a while now and decided to get my hands dirty and build something

Compass: An application that lets you find a cool destination spot for your holiday. It’s still a work in progress.

Pristine: An Authentication system where users can sign up, login, reset password amongst other features such as social sign up or login. This is to help improve my skills handling authentication in applications

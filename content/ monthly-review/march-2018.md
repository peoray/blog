To be honest, March wasn’t a great month. I had issues with my laptop and life got in the way a lot. Still, I was still able to learn a 
lot and made good use of the little opportunities I got to code.

## Coding Journey

- I learnt Vue. It is a progressive JavaScript framework which is lightweight and simple to use. It is the first JavaScript framework I have learnt so far. I have to say, Vue is beautiful and elegant to write. Before getting started, I was worried because I was unsure of what to expect but my mind was blown away by its simplicity.
  
- I also continued with my #100DaysOfCode Challenge. The challenge has given me the resolve to always open up my editor every day even if its just to look at the codes I wrote previously and run it in the browser.
  
- I also registered for the [LearnFactory](https://techpoint.ng/2017/12/06/learnfactory-aba-feature/) Bootcamp. The BootCamp promises to teach full stack JavaScript Technologies. I do hope to get in and then provide full details about it. Keeping my fingers crossed on this one.

## Projects

Having done less coding this time around, I considered it a personal victory to still be able to complete my [Todometer](https://github.com/peoray/Todometer) using Vue. It’s a simple to-do app like millions out there but it’s my code so I’m definitely proud of this one and it’s also my first project done with Vue.

## What’sUp April

- If I succeed in getting into the BootCamp, it would mean changing location for me as well as other stuff that would come up as a result. Hoping I succeed so I can utilize the opportunity.

- Notwithstanding, I will still continue learning Vue and getting better at it. Perhaps, move to a more complex project for practice.

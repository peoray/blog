As part of the stage 1 task from hotels.ng internship, participants were asked to test the [Timbu](https://timbu.com/) website and locate a single bug. After which participants were required to fill a google sheet with the location of the bug, its description and a link to a blog post written about the bug.

Here is my Finding:

- **Title:** No country flag icon for list of currencies

- **Description:** The dropdown for 'NGN' shows a list of country currecies. At first glance, it's looks messy and one has to strain their eyes to locate the currency they are looking for.

- **Expected result:** There should be country flag for better user experience

So this is something I think should be fixed. Thanks.

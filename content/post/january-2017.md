It’s a new year and so much new year goals are usually set. I also did set mine. Setting goals are easy but putting them into action and following them through is where most people fail. This is the hardest part and most people struggle to fulfill their plans for the new year.

It is important to know this and not be too hard on yourself if you are slacking off, nevertheless, it is simply not enough to have a plan, you need to put the plan into productive action.

I completed [The One Thing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16256798-the-one-thing) By Gary Keller and the book opened my eyes to a lot of secrets to great productivity which I’m gonna be applying to my daily life to increase my productivity.

## Coding Journey in January

- I Started the [100 Days of Code](http://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge and wrote all about it in [this article](https://codeburst.io/100daysofcode-lets-do-this-ac6649045bdc). This challenge has helped me tremendously in building up my coding habit. If you are looking for what to help you develop a habit of coding daily, then this challenge is perfect for you.
  
- I set a goal to learn something new each month and I certainly did that. I learnt how to make AJAX request using the `new HttpXMLRequest` and I went a step further by building a project with it.
  
- I did set a goal of building a minimum of four projects per month. While I did not succeed at this, I did make big progress, I built two projects. The fact that I did complete two projects is a big achievement in itself considering the fact I have never completed one before. Even though I fell short of my goals, I’m pretty happy with myself for doing something at least. It’s a good start and hopefully, I will build on this momentum and improve one step better. I may not have made big projects to show off but I did make significant projects and learnt a lot from the small projects I did. Now I’m happy I have real projects to show on my GitHub that is not copy and paste from a tutorial. The feeling is so surreal and it provides me with the motivation to keep going.

- Although I did have a goal to write a minimum of 52 articles (I laughed too when I wrote it down), I know it’s going to be hard to do this but I know I can and hopefully I get to achieve this. I’m doing the [#CodeNewbie](https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies) [#CNBC2018 challenge](http://2018.codenewbie.org/) to Blog More to help me build the habit of blogging about things I learn and my experiences which is the purpose of my writing in the first place.

- I put my CSS skills into practice and worked with Flexbox in a real project. I completed Day one of [#30days30sites](http://www.subscribepage.com/30days30sites), (a challenge that helps you build 30 things in 30 days) where I built a wedding landing page. I tried using Sass but I wasn’t making progress with the architecture. I was using the 7-in-1 folders arrangement and I was getting confused a lot and was wasting time, I decided to use normal CSS.
  
- I’m loving my [GitHub](https://github.com/peoray) contribution activity. True, most of them are due to my #100DaysOfCode log but the fact it contains real projects too is just exciting for me. To be honest, I found that they were actually very beneficial to keeping up my motivation.

## Projects Built

I built two projects during this month:

- The Number Facts Machine
- The Wedding Landing page.

## LESSON LEARNT

Coding along a tutorial to the core isn’t my thing. I get burned out pretty quickly. So I’m just gonna watch through the whole course which is comfortable for me and then implement the stuff I learn in my own projects.

Personally, I have come to realize it is the best and right way to learn. Use what you learn and build stuff. I’m sure you have heard it before but if you haven’t done so, the reality won’t hit you in the face the way it did for me

It’s important for me to know when that I can’t make a project perfect. Most times when building, there are lots of ideas coming into my head but I realized the more I work on them, I keep going down the rabbit with that one project and it gets larger than expected, not that this is bad but for learning purpose I feel it is better to continue moving on and learning other stuff and go back to it to iterate or fix something. Once I had the design up, I moved on and then continue to iterate more as I gain more knowledge but this time it’s just me trying to make it better this time. That’s where online courses come in, while I don’t always feel like coding along, it is important for me that I will have to use what I learned in my own project, that way the learning is more real to me cause when I want to use for my own project, it seems I understand it better and after then can do it on my own without watching the tutorial again.

A good example of this would be the projects I worked on. For the Number Facts project, I was stuck on a problem for 5 days. I couldn’t solve it, had to ask for help but meanwhile, I started working on the wedding page to get my mind off it. I needed an extra feature on it but couldn’t pull it off, if I had spent time trying to find a solution I wouldn’t have done so, to be honest, but taking time away from it proved vital and finally, help came and I was able to figure the rest from there on.
What’sup February?

- I hope to get started and learn more modern JavaScript with ES6 and hopefully use it in a few projects.

- Learn about `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `forEach` and other higher-order function
    
- Also, I want to learn how to use the Fetch API to make an asynchronous request since the XML method is considered old.
   
- Continue working on #30days30sites and try to complete at least two projects. I have a feeling this challenge will take me the whole year to complete.

- I will also focus heavily on core JavaScript projects to get better and also practice the things I will be learning.
  
- Complete reading Book One & Book two of [You Don’t Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS). The YDKJS book is highly recommended to truly master JavaScript, so I’m taking the plunge and see if I will truly become a master of the language or at least learn a lot.

PICKS

- The CodeNewbie [#CNBC2018](http://2018.codenewbie.org/) challenge is a challenge that is geared towards four aspects: Blog more, Code more, Start coding and Get a job. See the site for details.
    
- [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) released a New [CSS Grid course](https://cssgrid.io/) available for free. As long as it’s Wes, the course is definitely gonna worth your time.
    
- [Per Harald Borgen](https://twitter.com/perborgen) created a [Flexbox tutorial series](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-just-launched-a-free-full-length-flexbox-course-where-you-can-build-projects-interactively-1860e3d3c4af). He also has a free [CSS Grid course](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/heres-my-free-css-grid-course-merry-christmas-3826dd24f098) also.

This period has been my most productive since I started learning how to code and I believe I can do better and achieve great results.

_**Cheers!**_

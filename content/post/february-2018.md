I have been struggling with a poor Internet connection and somehow, life has gotten in the way, but nevertheless, I was still able to achieve a lot regardless.

I also completed reading [Awaken the Giant](https://www.amazon.com/Awaken-Giant-Within-Immediate-Emotional/dp/0671791540) in Me by Anthony Robbins. This book taught me a lot and it has given me enough determination that it is possible to achieve my dreams.

## Coding Journey

- I got accepted into Chingu Voyage-4 and I was also selected as a project manager. I did not complete my project in the last cohort. I failed miserably, my team just couldn’t make it happen, I tried working alone but quickly lost interest.
  
- I learnt how to use the Fetch API to make an asynchronous request. I used it in the currency converter project. You know you are progressing when you are able to take the things you learn and put them into useful practice.

- I completed the book one and book two of [You Don’t Know JavaScrip](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)t. I only read the book based on its huge popularity but I gotta admit, I didn’t gain much from it. It was a bit too technical for my liking.
  
- I completed the [Promises tutorial on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898). I have got to admit, it was really hard for me to come to grasp how they really work and how to use them in your projects.
  
- I completed [Mastering Responsive Web Design with HTML and CSS](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-responsive-web-design) by Ricardo Zea
  
- My ES6 got better and I was able to refactor the entire Quizzit project with it. I had lots of help from the Chingu slack community.
  
- I also learnt the importance of having someone do a code review for you. It’s refreshing to see I can write readable and efficient code for others to read and understand alongside with good comments. Thanks to [Shalvah A](https://twitter.com/theshalvah). for his help and advice in structuring code and using best practice.
  
- I completed the CSS Grid sections in the [Advanced CSS and Sass course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/v4/content). This really opened my eyes to the awesomeness and simplicity of CSS Grid. I’m super excited to now use it in my projects confidently.

- I did struggle again to write any technical blog posts, I have been failing at this goal, even though, my internet problems did not help, I still need to find a way to publish t least technical article regardless of the subject matter.
  
- Again, I failed to build my target of four projects but with the circumstances I faced, I’m only too glad I was able to build two projects.
  
- I have been doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I’m already half-way and I have decided to commit the remaining days of the challenge to learning Vue and building projects.

## Projects

- I built [Currency Converter](https://github.com/peoray/Currency-Converter). An app that changes Euros to Dollars.

- I did [Quizzit](https://github.com/peoray/Quizzit), an online quiz app, nothing fancy. it looks ugly, although I hope to refactor it soon.

## What’sup March

- Start learning about VueJS. It is a lightweight JavaScript Library used to build single page applications and many other useful applications, This will be my first forage into JavaScript frameworks and libraries, hopefully, the learning steep will not be difficult.
  
- I also hope to complete one of 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge. I didn’t get to build anyone this month mostly cause I was stuck with learning CSS Grid and desperately wanted to use it in the project.

## PICKS

- [35 project to have on your GitHub](https://shenomads.com/35-projects-you-can-add-to-github-to-show-off-your-dev-skills/) is a really cool list of projects you can build and show off on your GitHub as well as your portfolio.
  
- [30 Days of CSS](https://codecollege.ca/) is a free 30 days tutorial on CSS where you build a cool simple project making use of latest CSS features.
  
- Kuba Michalski is a very good friend who recently completed the Google Code-in challenge. I’m super proud of him for going all the way. He wrote about his [experience in this article](https://medium.com/@kubamichalski/my-last-google-code-in-is-over-e94317f653c5).

_**Cheers!**_

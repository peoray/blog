It's 2:26am and I have just finished listening to Swyx podcast on FreeCodeCamp. I feel like trying this idea, so from today, I will be trying this idea for the rest of the year with my guthub streak as a way to see myself achieving this

It's amazing how we set goals, make all the plans but doing the most important thing which isgetting started is very difficult and most times, you don't even start at all and end up procrastinating, i'm in that situation right now. 

I'm taking this challenge for myself to be able to achieve my goals.

I had great ideas for this blog as well but till date,  I have only succeeded in writing just one article. it's really sad but this is my reality.

Starting from today, I'll be doing something code-related every single day with a blog at the end of the month highlihting how my month went and stuff I learned

My github streak will be green for every sinle column for the next 365 days, be it for personal projects, a sinl eletter on my blog or on my journal making plans and resuffling my plans (yes, I'm counting this as well)

I believe on goals setting, somehow it always makes me see the bigger picture, the direction I'm heading to and put everything in perspective, it helps to direct how I think because I think along the goals I have set already and make changes as deem fit

This is a despearate measure for me to stick to my goals and follow them through. 

This will not include my tasks from work as this is solely focus on my personal development and improving myself to be a better developer

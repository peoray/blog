This article is credited to [Bolu Ajibawo](https://medium.com/@Bolu_Ajibawo) whose monthly series of writing about his challenges and struggles inspired me to start doing same. This way, I get to share my journey to become a world-class developer with you and also share other areas of my life that are worth sharing.

In my last article, I wrote about starting over again because I felt my first approach wasn‚Äôt going according to plan and after a forced lengthy period without a computer, I had a deep reflection and decided to do all I can to make it right this time.

So this month has really been definitive for me. Clearer goals and things going according to plan. I set out with becoming comfortable with stuff that was uncomfortable to me. So how did November 2017 go?

## Coding Journey in November

- I came up with a [learning tracker](https://github.com/peoray/My-Learning-Tracker) as a way to gauge my skills and see how far I‚Äôm able to achieve in terms of a particular stack. This was inspired by [Syk Houdeib](https://twitter.com/Syknapse) [learning tracker](https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker) I came across on GitHub and decided to implement mine. It sure gives me a sense of direction on what to learn at a particular period.

- I was able to level up my CSS skills in areas I was weak at or mainly scared to even look over such as CSS Animations, Transitions and Translate, Responsive Design, Flexbox and CSS Grid. I‚Äôm taking Jonas Advanced CSS course to gain more knowledge.
    
- Also this month, I completed a full [Udemy course on HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman) and I‚Äôm already halfway through another of his course which is mainly focused on [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/v4/t/lecture/8274554?start=0). The first course I completed was nice, although it uses old floats and positioning and for someone like me trying to move away from all that because it‚Äôs just a pain to use them project-wise because I feel I‚Äôm not confident using them. The course uses too much 3rd parties libraries in my opinion especially for the grid when he used a grid framework where I was hoping we would use pure CSS. My favorite part of the course was his really helpful and useful tips about web designs such as colors, typography, etc.. There is a [free course](https://www.udemy.com/web-design-secrets/) for that section. Also, the course contains some useful CSS styling I can use for my personal projects and I learnt how to style things differently than I‚Äôm used to. I also learnt how to structure your project folder when developing. Also, about website optimization and the course E-Book is a treasure bag.

- I have also improved in my Git knowledge. I decided to put in the work and skip using videos and read a comprehensive book instead. Currently, I‚Äôm reading [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and so far, it‚Äôs been good. I have definitely moved up in my knowledge bar than my basic knowledge of Git and I haven‚Äôt even gone halfway, the book is easily the best you can find on Git. As a developer, [Git is essential](https://medium.com/@chuucksc/4-reasons-why-you-should-use-git-b722772a011f), so gaining a stronghold on the topic will definitely be an advantage and prove to your potential employers you are a serious developer. The Pro Git is super beginner friendly to start with if you don‚Äôt know Git, also [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9goXbgTDQ0n_4TBzOO0ocPR) has a playlist on getting you started up with some of the stuff you use Git for.

Certain people have been a source of inspiration and motivation for me lately most notably [Egwuenu Gift](https://twitter.com/lauragift21) and [Bolu Ajibawo](https://medium.com/@Bolu_Ajibawo).

Bolu has always been someone I have watched out for since coming across his articles and talking with him on Chingu slack channel. His [courage applying for a job](https://medium.com/@Bolu_Ajibawo/preparing-for-a-non-technical-interview-my-booking-com-iamthecode-experience-ed05d971e051) is definitely noteworthy, it‚Äôs not easy finding the balance as to when you are technically ready, let alone a job at an international company. That has really inspired to keep going at it and trust the process.

Egwuenu Gift inspired me to write beyond my personal experience and write about technical stuff and I don‚Äôt have to be world class developer to give a technical explanation of a concept I feel either pretty much comfortable with or learning. Her article about [Understanding Vuex and how it works](https://medium.com/@laurandidi21/understanding-vuex-and-how-it-works-f6372b1ee286) was selected as the winner for Stephanie Hurlburt competition for writing a technical article and even Sean Larkin, a core member of the Webpack team got to comment, how cool is that!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">*drumroll please*<br><br>The winner is <a href="https://twitter.com/lauragift21?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lauragift21</a> for this post.

So aside from personal experience and soft skills, I will write technical articles and even tutorials, just to see how I will fare.

On a side note, I really commend what Stephanie Hurlburt is doing for women in tech and I‚Äôm pretty sure she is a huge inspiration for all women folks out there and she writes in C++, how cool is that! If you are on twitter, you should definitely follow her.

_P.S I started with C++ and I almost went insane. I think it was complete idiot‚Äôs guide to C++, never picking up that book again._

## Personal Publication

I also decided to open a personal publication so I can have all my writings in one place even if I still write for other popular publications and after running around looking for a suitable name from the Blog of Emmanuel Raymond to Brainbox, I have decided to settle for Raymond‚Äôs Blog. I just feel this one is right, so I think I‚Äôm gonna be sticking with it for good and move on with my life!

## Chingu Voyage

[Chingu](https://twitter.com/chingucollabs) is at it again; we are on a journey to [build 1000 projects by 2020](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/Chingu-dev-adventures). It‚Äôs hugely ambitious. If you don‚Äôt already know what Chingu is: It is simply the best community for learning web development. Chingu is made up of people from all over the world who help one another learn web development (novice or expert). [Chance Taken](https://medium.com/@tropicalchancer) is the facilitator and he is just so cool.

![people lying down](https://res.cloudinary.com/peoray/image/upload/v1528381736/chingu_uccyhf.jpg)

Chingu Voyage is a program where people are split into teams of 3‚Äì4 people to work on various projects. Some are building really cool landing pages, chrome extensions, bots, job boards etc. But sadly for me, that hasn‚Äôt been the case. I haven‚Äôt completed a single project and I have been in as many as eight cohorts already, mostly cause myself and my team haven‚Äôt been living up to expectations. It‚Äôs hard to work with different people remotely but I want to see it through this time.

## Tech Meetups

In November, I attended DevFestSE, it‚Äôs the biggest tech event in Nigeria where Google experts and top developers and players in the tech industry give talks based on Google technologies. It was my first time attending a technical meetup per se and it was everything I imagined it to be. Also, I got to meet some of my friends I interact with on Twitter and even got some swags.

![GDG group photo](https://res.cloudinary.com/peoray/image/upload/v1528382004/aba_yvwmb3.jpg)

Also, Techpoint during their South-South and South-East tours came to [Port-Harcourt](https://techpoint.ng/2017/11/08/day-3-port-harcourt-meetup/) and [Umuahia](https://techpoint.ng/2017/11/14/umuahia-meetup/) and I had the opportunity to attend both events. It was really a cool session as several issues were raised and dealt with particularly issues pertaining to tech communities and startups in Nigeria, the challenges and way forward. I pretty much learnt a lot and it was cool to see the real faces behind the awesome articles I read from the website every day.

## StartUp Weekend Aba

So I went to my first hackathon in November, Startup weekend Aba. It was truly a first time experience for me and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt change my mind at the last minute not to attend. Even though my team didn‚Äôt win (we didn‚Äôt even come close), it sure gave me an experience of building something from the ground up where all you have is your idea and you have to do surveys, validations, feedback, development and all it entails to build an MVC. Definitely, something gained moving on.
What‚Äôsup December?

- My plans for this month is pretty solid, I plan to get started on Sass and JavaScript. While I‚Äôm familiar with the basics of JavaScript, it‚Äôs time to step it up and learn past the basics to intermediate and advanced concepts.
    
- I also plan on doing personal projects, away from the tutorials. Hopefully, at the end of the month, I would have a number of projects to show off. This is very important as this is the only way I get to really understand what I have learnt so far.

- I hope to make significant progress in my Chingu Voyage with my teammates, hope we can get the job done. Really hopeful!

- I also decided to start reading, so I will be picking up reading, maybe start small with a book for a month. At least that‚Äôs realistic for someone that has never completed a book before.

## Picks

- [Muna](https://medium.com/@munamohamed94) article about [Frontend development](https://codeburst.io/front-end-development-is-not-what-you-think-d347b638b6d9) says a lot. Web development is not an easy journey, especially for frontend development.

- [Sam Jarman](https://medium.com/@samjarman) [Junior Dev Diaries](https://www.samjarman.co.nz/diaries) is a blog series aimed at junior Software Engineers.

- [Frontend Checklist](https://frontendchecklist.io/) is awesome as it helps to know what‚Äôs necessary to implement.

So, I did achieve a lot this compare to how I have been faring over the past year being stuck in my comfort zone. It‚Äôs not a smooth journey but I have to constantly remind myself to trust the process, it‚Äôs not a sprint but a marathon and not a means to an end. I do hope to get better each day as I continue to learn and build stuff.

**_Cheers!_**

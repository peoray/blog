December has been small steps for me. However, I turned 22. Wow, that’s a lot. Sometimes I’m scared of growing up.

I have come a long way in terms of maturity and taking responsibilities. I didn’t expect November to be easy and it didn’t disappoint. Somehow, even after committing to changing your life and taking positive actions to make it better, there is always something that’s gonna draw you back. For me, it was doubt and uncertainty.

## Coding Journey in November

In my last monthly recap article, I wrote about starting to find my feet, attending meet-ups and defining my purpose again. My major goals for the month were pretty straightforward. To recap, I was to become familiar with Sass and move beyond JavaScript basics. Also, to practice building stuff and collaborate with my teammates via the Chingu Voyage to build a clone of BBC News Page. Although I made good progress, I didn’t make the kind of progress I’d love to make, but nonetheless, there were small steps made.

- I did start learning Sass and it’s freaking awesome especially when working on large projects and you need an architecture for your project.

- Also, I started to use CSS Grid and I completely fell in love with it, definitely prefer it over Flexbox. Although both can be used together, Grid is just easy and convenient to use in my opinion. [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7tLPhnA06w) has a good playlist to help you get started.

- I made progress on the [Advanced CSS and Sass Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/v4/t/lecture/8274554?start=0), still yet to finish the first project but I’m happy with my progress with this one. Also, the course has a full Flexbox and CSS Grid Section, definitely worth giving it a try if you have the buck$!

## What’sup January?

It’s a new year and it brings new expectations.

- My plans for this month is to focus on JavaScript. I wasn’t able to fully focus this month because I was carried away by Sass and CSS Grid. I hope to complete [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/) by Anthony Alicea and maybe another course to solidify the concepts.

- I hope to finish Advanced CSS and Sass course. The course is the one of the best if not the best-advanced CSS course on Udemy, I highly recommended. If you follow along, you will definitely learn a lot.

- I will be starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge. This will not the first time I’m attempting the challenge, first time I got to day 50 and stopped due to exams. But this time around, I’m pumped and ready to give it another go.

- Practice and push to GitHub. While I didn’t do a full-blown project this month (just building blocks), I do hope to be able to use my skills gained during this month and build simple layouts for starters. I hope inthe end, I would have projects to show off.

## Picks

- [Lydia Hallie](https://medium.com/@lydiahallie) article on [How To Successfully Teach Yourself How To Code](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/successfully-teaching-yourself-how-to-code-f6aac23db44a) and [What New Developers Should Really Focus On](https://medium.com/@lydiahallie/what-new-developers-should-really-focus-on-9da2eb5cf10c) is definitely worth checking out especially for newbies like me as there are valuable advice and tips to help you out. Lydia explains why it is important to consider small steps as gainful victory so you won’t lose motivation and give up. And it applied so much to me this month, with Sass and CSS Grid, I was able to learn something entirely new which is the goal. To get better each day, bit by bit.

- [Indrek Lasn](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@wesharehoodies) article about [The secret to being a top developer is building things! Here’s a list of fun apps to build!](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-secret-to-being-a-top-developer-is-building-things-heres-a-list-of-fun-apps-to-build-aac61ac0736c) is definitely something you should check if you are out of ideas on what to build.

So I did step up this month and it can only get better, looking forward to the next month and the new year and hope it brings good tidings for everyone.

_**Cheers!**_

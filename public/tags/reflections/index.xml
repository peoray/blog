      <description>2018 has been a wonderful year regardless of the setbacks that happened, it was truly my best year yet. I have probably grown more this year than any other year in the past. Last year, I had lots of goals I wanted to achieve before this day, while I completed most, attempted a few and completely didn&amp;rsquo;t do some, looking back, I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for the position I am in because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so 365 days ago.</description>

      <description>2107 has been a great year despite many ups and downs, Iâ€™m excited about everything that happened and especially the progress I made personally in various aspects of my life. I also managed to learn more about myself and how I handle adversity and setbacks in my life.
Graduation Overall, 2017 was an average year. My biggest achievement has to be my graduating from college. I studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering and it was a great relief to finally come to the end of my program.</description>

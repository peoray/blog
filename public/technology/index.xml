      <description>I have been writing code for over two years and looking back, it amazes me the number of things I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet. It&amp;rsquo;s a rat-race trying to catch up with the industry, the more you try hard to catch up, the further you realize you are behind. I want to use this opportunity to list out some programming technologies I don&amp;rsquo;t know.
This is kind of a journal for me to see what I don&amp;rsquo;t know as of 2018.</description>

      <description>I asked my first question on StackOverflow today and within minutes, I got answers to my question. Unlike what I read online about difficulties in asking a question, mine was actually easy. Aside from insisting I used a title that describes the question and no one has used before which took few minutes, everything went well.
What was your experience when you asked your first ever question on StackOverflow?</description>

      <title>My First #100DaysOfCode Experience</title>

      <description>I completed my #100DaysOfCode challenge on 20th April 2018. In case you are wondering what it is, I wrote an article when I started the challenge. The whole idea of the challenge is that you publicly commit to coding every day for 100 days. During this period, my experience has both been overwhelming and underwhelming. In this article, I hope to highlight my experience and also to offer advice to others doing it to make it more effective and gain the best out of it.</description>

      <title>Building my First Project: Numbers Facts Machine</title>

      <description>UPDATE: I finally managed to host the app thanks to The Shalvah
Check out the app here
This is the first ever project I completed and I got the inspiration from Brad Traversy YouTube video. I decided to add my own features and include options for both year and date request.
The project is based on the Numbers API where the data is gotten from. The documentation on the usage of the API is pretty straightforward and It’s a free API.</description>

      <description>WHAT IS IT? This is a challenge that was created by Alexander Kallaway and he first wrote this article about it. Since then, it has garnered so much support in the field that it has now become a norm, especially for beginners like myself. The goal of the whole challenge as highlighted by Kallaway is to ensure you code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.</description>
